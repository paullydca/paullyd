I am the owner/founder of **[Beyond the Pixel](https://www.beyondthepx.com)**, a design agency focused on web and graphic design, as well brand management. I adore coffee, mountain bikes, hiking, and Jesus. Much of my time is occupied by raising my 4 kids in this great city Saint John, NB. 

His has been working as a designer for over a decade. Previously I was a bicycle mechanic but lost the ability to do physical work due to illness which has caused me to rediscover many talents and skills. I am now focused on helping brands stand out through great design and emotion, my goal is to help grow local businesses.

As a hobby I blog on various topics that come to mind.
